####How I know the Google Summer of Code.

It's really a exciting experience to participate Google Summer of Code. In October of Last year, I first know Google Summer of Code in internet, and decide to apply this year. 

####How I prepare and apply for the Google Summer of Code.

In March, I noticed the beginning of GSoC of 2014. So I start to find suitable organization and project. During the application period, I discussed with my mentor about our project.  I start to learn the code of RTEMS and POK, also make notes and write post about my understanding. By reading the Email of last year and also the blog of my mentor in last year, I make a schedule and outline of our target in this summer. 

####The life in the Google Summer of Code.

On May 19, the Google Summer of Code began. I start to working for RTEMS. There are two way to communicate with my mentor. First, our community has a meeting every Tuesday. In that meeting, every students should report there work of last week, and submit a plan of last week. If I got any problem and put it on the meeting, all the mentors will help me to get a solution. The second way is through the mail-list. If I got any advance in progress, I send an email to notify my mentor. 

The first problem I solved is separating the normal POK kernel and VMM code. Then I implement the Hypercall. These two parts is on my schedule, so I finished them quickly. Then my mentor suggest me to add a VMM in POK, this is not in my plan. So I start to reading papers, books and the source code of other project. Then I make a design of our vCPU. This part is quite tough for me, not because of the vCPU is complicated, but I did not know the concept of vCPU before. There is a word from my friend: we all are learning, but we just begin early. 

Another interesting phenomenon is the time difference, I have two mentors. one of them is locate in Germany, and the other is in NYC. And I was in China. As a result, in every hour, there must be one of us lives under the sun. It's the Google connect us together from all over the world.
